This project’s CSS files are built upon a structural skeleton extracted 
from GNOME Shell. While the specific creative property values (colors, 
fonts, etc.) are original works licensed under Apache 2.0, the 
functional arrangement and identifiers are derived from the original 
LGPL 2.1 source. 

The CSS files in this project use functional identifiers (class names 
and IDs) originally found in the GNOME Shell default theme (Copyright 
Red Hat, Inc. and Intel Corporation). 

These identifiers are used solely for interoperability to interface 
with the GNOME Shell UI. All creative property values (colors, 
spacing, etc.) are original works of Schwarzen and are licensed
