## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

We prefer that you use GitHub's **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature. This keeps the conversation private while we work on a fix.

1. Navigate to the [Security tab](https://github.com/Schwarzen/colormydesktop/security) of this repository.
2. Under "Reporting", click on **Advisories**.
3. Click **Report a vulnerability** to submit your report.

Alternatively, you can contact the maintainer directly via email at IIAnimosityII@gmail.com.

### Our Process
- **Acknowledgement**: You will receive an initial response within 48 hours.
- **Triage**: We will notify you if the report is accepted or requires more info.
- **Fix**: We aim to release a patched version within 30 days of a confirmed report.
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you to publish a Security Advisory once the fix is live.

## Bug Bounty Program
Currently, Color-My-Desktop is a small project and does not offer financial rewards for reports. However, we are happy to:
- Provide public credit

Thank you for helping keep Color-My-Desktop secure!
